# Mutant strategies analisys
## Remove mutants generated by the X operators that generated the most mutants

Given an input matrix of mutants and test cases' results, remove the mutants
generated by the X operators that generated the most killable mutants.

Repository structure

**./** 'Implementation files'

**./[TestCaseSetSelection/]("https://github.com/GiovaniGuizzo/TestCaseSetSelection")** -> Giovanni Guizzo's Repo that implements the 
algorithm that finds a testcase subset with a good score

**./[sources/]("https://github.com/jacksonpradolima/SUTs4MutationTesting")** -> Contains the source matrixes of the studied problems calculed 
by Jackson Lima [problems]

## Running all scripts
Execute the following command to run all scripts with default values and stores
results to file './results.hash'
> ./run.sh

If you just want to clean the generated files add clean argument (keeps the 
'results.hash' file)
> ./run.sh clean

##### If you want to run just one part of the process, read the following instructions
## Runs Selective Mutation strategy
Only generates the directory MS within each problem's methods' root.
If no X operators are given, calculates for 2,5 and 10
> ./selective.rb sources/

#### or
Add the X operators to remove its mutants
> ./selective.rb sources/ x1,x2,x3,x4

### Outputs
#### Result are written to:
> sources/[problem]/MS/MS_<n>.csv 

#### The mutants generated by the X operators removed from results are saved as:
> sources/[problem]/MS/MS_<n>_removed.csv

## Running the testcase set optimization
Run the following will create a file prefixed by testcases_[result_file].csv 
inside each directory of problems' methods
> ./run_test_case_selection.sh

## Calculating scores
Runs the testcases generated before with the correspoding alives FOMs matrix
and get the score for each strategy result
> ./get_scores.rb sources/

Using the --summary flag the result hash will be aggregated by each strategy 
instead of each result file
