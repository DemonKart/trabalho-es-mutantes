# Mutant strategies analisys
## Remove mutants generated by the X operators that generated the most mutants

Given an input matrix of mutants and test cases' results, remove the mutants
generated by the X operators that generated the most killable mutants.

### Usage
if no X operators are given, calculates for 2,5 and 10
> ./selective.rb sources/[problem]/Foms/results.csv 

#### or
> ./selective.rb sources/[problem]/Foms/results.csv x1,x2,x3,x4

### Outputs
#### Result are written to:
> sources/[problem]/MS/MS_<n>.csv 

#### The mutants generated by the X operators removed from results are saved to:
> sources/[problem]/MS/removed/MS_<n>.csv
